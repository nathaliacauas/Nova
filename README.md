**Descriptor:**
"""Chef's Hat is a four player card game where your goal is to discard all cards before the other players do.
At the beginning of the game every player receives a set of cards at their hand representing pizza ingredients.
The players discard the cards at the game board which represents a pizza.
To discard a card, the player follows a set of game rules which dictate which cards they can discard depending on the cards on the board.
Sometimes the player cannot discard a set of cards and they have to pass.
As the goal is to discard all the cards at hand, passing does not contribute to this goal.
During the game, if three out of the four players pass, the player that did not pass makes one pizza, removing all the cards on the board.
After making the pizza, this players gets to choose which cards of their hand will be on the board.

For each pizza, we calculate a set of metrics for each player.
These metrics represent the behavior of each player based on the actions they chose before the pizza was made.
The metrics are:
Attack: represents how effective was the action the player made,
by counting the amount of players that could not discard any card and then chose the action pass after this action.

Attack can have these values:
0: No players passed after the action.
1: One player passed after the action.
2: Two players passed after the action.
3: Three players passed after the action.

Vitality represents the number of non-pass actions the player did during that pizza.
0: Player didn't discard.
1: Player discarded once.
2: Player discarded twice.

Defense measures the amount of players that did the pass action before the current player discard action.
This measures the impact of a discard action of the current player in disrupting another player's discard action.
0 : The action the current players disrupted did not made any other player pass.
1 : The action the current players disrupted made one other player pass.
2 : The action the current players disrupted made two other players pass.


You are my assistant and I need you to help me describing the players behavior in the chef's hat game.
I'll give you the information in this format:
[Player_name, Attack, Defense, Vitality]

With these information and using only the context I gave you,

Don't mistake discarding once with discarding one card.
In the response, you must not express any amount of cards, for example, don't say "a card", "one card" or "a single card".
Remember you are not talking about the cards, you are talking about the act of discarding.

You will reply in this format:
[Player name, Your reply]
